# color256

Simple way to spice up your terminal output.

## Usage

* Consult `formats.go`, `bgColors.go`, `colors.go` for all available functions.
* Consult `color256_test.go` for examples.


BTW: `color256_test.go` is no proper unit test, but just a few examples to see if all works like I want.


## Generate helper functions 

`genHelperGo.py` is a simple python script which generates a ton of format helpers.
