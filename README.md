# color256

Simple way to spice out your terminal output.



## Credits:

Huge parts are actually from https://github.com/esimov/diagram/blob/master/color/color.go

I just made a library out of it, so I can use it im my projects as a replacement for this awesome library https://github.com/fatih/color, where I got the idea of an own type for Colors and Formats, and to check if a terminal even can show colors.
